    <p>School education is way off considering receiving knowledge from the University. Before
attending university the most recent way of life is Advanced Level. Which
is simply cramming knowledge down your brain and mind for two years. Success of this process
will be determined by the GCE AL Exam conducted at the country level. After a complicated
process of calculating a metric called Z-score students are selected to the State Universities
in Sri Lanka.</p>

<p>Let me be clear, no part time degrees are awarded for students. Which means a minimum time for
a degree is three years, special degrees have a span of four years and medical degrees take five
years to completion. If you think success of University education is measured similar to AL exams,
no it does not work that way (Thankfully). An academic year consists of two semesters. Each semester
comprising of assignments, tutorials, mid semester exam and end semester exam(depends on the course
and lecturer, SADLY). This amount of diversity gives the opportunity for students to focus on their
humane skills.</p>

<p>Let me connect the knowledge measuring activities with humane skills</p>

<ol>
<li>Individual Assignment - Critical thinking and self learning.</li>
<li>Group Assignment - Communication skills and handling people.</li>
<li>Tutorial - Sharing techniques and comparing answers.</li>
<li>Mid and End semester exam - Managing time and material to study.</li>
</ol>

<p>In above four situations there is one common skill which improves gradually, finding-materials-
in-the-library-or-internet-and-be-happy-that-you-finally-learned-something-about-what-you-are-
searching. The joy after completing any of the above will make you speechless. GPA calculated at
the end of the university education is made of such above multiple tests through all academic years.
In a job interview know how to market your skills. Even if the degree and the job specifications
do not match only to make a positive impression.</p>

<p>Most important part in university life is knowing how to make professional connections with tutors,
lectures, fellow batch mates and non-academic staff members. This will literally save you from a lot
of embarrassments in the job hunt or applying for higher education degrees. Most important things are
addressing people, amount of content, omitting or including specific words, medium of choice and
finally when to connect. Take your time and do research before you communicate professionally because
the first impression makes a huge difference. Researching part will be automatically encoded in
your habit if you regularly do individual projects at the university.</p>

<p>Always remember that none the above four have smooth deadlines specially as you are following multiple
courses from different subjects. So do not wait until the last moment to complete them and regret that
you did not do enough. If you want to finish early always plan ahead and be prepared. This is also a
useful lesson which you can transfer to your work life.</p>

<p>I believe that the sad state of affairs is which students do not know how to market these skills or
use them. Let me remind having cool grades with humane skills was an advantage a decade ago, but now
this is compulsory.</p>
