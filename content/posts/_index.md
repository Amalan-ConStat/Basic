Sorry I have not written anything here yet. Eventually I will and it will be a miracle. To be honest there is lot to say most about how to be a tactful person using the TV shows and Movies watched, books and social media content read, finally different people met.

Further, I should and will rant or advice regarding statistics or Data related topics. The amount of work done with related to data using statistical concepts and R programming gives me that right. I will be completely biased towards R.

I promise you that atleast three posts will be posted by the end of this year, 2019.
