Not exactly the most outspoken person, yet I traveled this far as a Millennial. The name is Amalan Mahendran with a knack for Data, Statistics and R programming. You can understand me with more detail from my [research](https://amalan-con-stat.netlify.com) site. 

In the world of social media users I only use [twitter](https://twitter.com/Amalan_Con_Stat), with the focus on communicating with similar people who love Statistics, R programming and Minimalism. I know that Minimalism is new, yet this is practiced as doing things that are needed. I believe in the past it is called being middle class, Well now it just has a cool name.  

Watching TV Shows and Movies has been much more useful for me while programming. I am just using this website to write more and improve my skills in converting ideas to words. Specially after completing GRE and IELTS(I know it sounds very greedy). Advance apologies because most of my posts will be rants about free education, statistics application, political and climate change.

Finally, when it comes to music I have no specific preference unless when I am working it is classical music directly related to classical music.
